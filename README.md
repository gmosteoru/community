# CommUnity
A project for the community, powered by the community

Our aim is to bring the local community together in facing immediate threats or in sharing joyful events.

- Have you ever passed by a location only to find out later about the show taking place inside?
- Have you ever visited a new town only to miss the best stake around?
- Have you ever found you out in a dangerous situation, needing immediate action, only to be frustrated not knowing about it earlier?
- Have you ever wanted to notify the community about all these?

CommUnity is a project composed of a mobile app and a web app.
The mobile app:
- enables you to create events, be notified about them and endorse them.
- you can configure your preferences, so that you will receive live warnings just from the events you are interested in
- you will only receive notifications when you approach the events location
- endorsing an event is only possible when near the location.
- the application will also contain a wall of events
- you can filter events on the wall
The web app:
- gives you an overview of all the events
- will contain a wall of events
- you can filter events on the wall
- you can check statistics of the events

The CommUnity project aims to become an opensource, easy to use and deploy, community driven, customizable platform for NGOs and institutions
